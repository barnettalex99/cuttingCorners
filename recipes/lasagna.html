    <p> Often lasagna recipes have a cook time of 8 hours, or require 4 types of meat and homemade sauce that has to sit overnight. Those lasagna dishes are delicious. This Lasagna recipe cuts all of the corners and still is. And it makes enough that you can eat it for the rest of the week. </p>
    <ul id="ingredients">
        <li>1 lb ground sweet italian sausage </li>
        <li>12 oz can crushed tomatoes </li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced </li>
        <li>2 Tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 pacakage Oven Ready Lasagna Noodles</li>
        <li> 16 oz container Ricotta cheese</li>
        <li> 2 cups Shredded Mozzerella</li>
        <li> salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li> Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. </li>
        <li> In a large saucepan, add the minced garlic and the olive oil. </li>
        <li> Add the ground sausage and cook until it is cooked through. It will appear brown and crumbling.</li>
        <li> Add the crushed tomatoes to the saucepan. Salt and pepper the sauce to preferred taste.</li>
        <li> Cover the bottom of the baking pan with the meat sauce and top with the noodles so that they do not overlap. Keep in mind that the noodles will expand as they cook. Cover the noodles with another layer of sauce. </li>
        <li> Spread 1/2 cup of the ricotta over the sauce. Then, sprinkle 1/3 cup of mozzerella on top.  </li>
        <li> Repeat layering 2-3 more times.</li>
        <li> Cover with aluminum foil and bake 30 minutes. Then remove the foil and cook for another 10 minutes. </li>
        <li> Can be easily reheated in the microwave with good results (I sometimes even like it better this way). </li>
    </ol>
